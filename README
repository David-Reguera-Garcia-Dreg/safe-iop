This repository is for safe-iop experimentation until a final interface
is decided upon.  Many approaches have been tested, but each have had
their limitations.  On one side, transparency for the developer is
crucial, but on the other side, so is portability.  The real goal of
this project would be to create a library which meets both of those
needs maximally.


We'll see if it's possible.
